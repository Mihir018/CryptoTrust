## About
  In our project we are creating an ICO with the help of ERC20 tokens, and ERC721 tokens (NFT). So whenever the investor is funding the company it goes to a contract, instead going straight to the company. Whenever the company want to take the money out, they need to request the contract for money. In request they would specify
1. Amount
2. a reason or the use of that money
3. public address of the account/s where they are going to spend the money on.

  As smart contract works , based on the voting poll if the permission is given by more than 50% of the investors, only then the owner will be able to use the       money, which only will happen when the request made by company seems trustworthy.
  
  ## USP
  We are introducing the NFT in this project , i.e. each investor will be provided with NFT tokens , based upon their investment. Furthur we are also implementing   KYC verification for the investors, on completion of which a NFT token (which will indicate their verification) will be given to him/her.
  Our main feature is the voting system on which the actions of company can be visible, thus making it a trustworthy ICO.
